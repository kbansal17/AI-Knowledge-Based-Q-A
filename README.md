# AI Knowledge-Based Q&A System (Automated with Ansible)

This project is an AI-powered Knowledge-Based Question and Answer (Q&A) system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to answer user questions based on a custom knowledge base. It includes an Ansible playbook to automate the local deployment of the Flask web application.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Answer user queries from a pre-defined knowledge base (`kb.json`)
- Flask-based web application
- Interactive frontend for Q&A
- Ansible playbook to automate installation and deployment
- Auto-start Flask app in background during provisioning

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **JSON** (for storing the question-answer pairs)
- **Ansible** (for automating environment setup)

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- Git
- Ansible (run on WSL or a Unix-based system)

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (Manual Run)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbansal17/AI-Knowledge-Based-Q-A.git
cd AI-Knowledge-Based-Q-A
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask app

```bash
python app.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

---

## 🤖 Ansible Deployment

### 1. Go to the `ansible` folder:

```bash
cd ansible
```

### 2. Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
```

This will:

- Install Python and pip
- Clone the repo
- Install Python requirements
- Start the Flask app in the background

---

## 💡 How to Use

- Open the app in a browser at: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- Ask questions like `what is html`, `define AI`, etc.
- You must type close to the full question in `kb.json` (e.g., "html" may not work — try "what is html")

---

## 🧠 Improving Match Accuracy

If you want the app to understand keywords like "html" instead of full questions, enhance `app.py` logic:

- Lower fuzzy match threshold
- Add a "contains keyword" condition
- Add multiple variants of a question in `kb.json`
