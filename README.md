# AI Knowledge-Based Q&A System

This project implements an AI-powered Knowledge-Based Question and Answer (Q&A) system using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system allows users to ask questions, and it provides relevant answers based on a predefined knowledge base.

## Features

- Interactive Q&A system powered by AI.
- Easy-to-use interface for asking questions.
- Provides relevant answers based on a stored knowledge base (JSON file).
- Error handling for unrecognized questions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For backend logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework to create the API and serve the frontend.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend layout and styling.
- **JSON**: For storing the knowledge base (questions and answers).
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements on the frontend.
